Since I didn't keep archives up until December 13, 2014, I'm not entirely sure
when the big change to the tag system happened(utilizing descriptors). 

In my oldest files I have been able to find a piece of the system modified on October 10, 2014 wherein the new system was(in that context) finished. 

I found a backup folder containing files of the old system where all the files 
had timestamps on the same day, but different hour and minute times. This leads
me to believe the files were the last copy that were being messed with before the
changeover. The timestamp on them was September 6, 2014.

I remember it taking about a few weeks to create the new system so from the
evidence I've gathered it seems safe to say this:

"Descriptor" system production started near: 
    October 10, 2014
"Descriptor" system production completed near:
    September 6, 2014
