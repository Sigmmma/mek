The MEK(Mo's Editing Kit) is my collection of tools I've made for editing Halo.
This will be updated whenever I commit changes, which means you guys can check
in whenever to see if something is new.


Installation:

1. Install Python 3.5 or higher. While installing, choose "Custom Installation",
    and make sure these are checked:

        Add Python3.X to PATH

        Optional Features:
            pip
            tcl/tk and IDLE

        Advanced Options:
            Associate files with Python
            Create shortcuts for installed applications
            Add Python to environment variables

2. Run VC++14.0_BuildTools.exe

3. Run MEK_Installer.pyw

4. Choose whether or not to install the MEK's libraries in a portable fashion
    (to a local directory) or to the machine you are running. Make sure that
    "install up-to-date MEK" is checked so it will download the rest of the
    MEK to the current directory.

5. Click "Install/Update"

6. If the installer fails because it says pip is not installed, close it and
    run get-pip.py to install pip. When it finishes, go back to step 2.



Updating:

1. Run MEK_Installer.pyw
2. Click "Install/Update"



Troubleshooting:

* If you encounter an error while running the MEK installer, make sure to check the
"show detailed information" box and run it again. Send me a message with the output
and your system's information so I can fix it.

* If programs wont run at all, Python might not have been added to your system's PATH
environment variable. Google how to fix this, or run the python installer again to
uninstall it and re-install it with at least the options specified above ticked.

* If programs wont load or save tags then you have a permissions issue where python
isnt being allowed to modify/make files in the directory you are in.

One way to fix this is to change the folder permissions on the folder you are trying
to edit tags in. It turns out that this is caused by certain versions of windows due
to some of their security measures, like UAC.

* If you changed config settings and now a program wont load or the gui is too messed up
up to easily use, delete the config file. If you installed the MEK portably, the config
file will be here(MEK is the directory you installed the MEK to):
    MEK\mek_lib\mozzarilla\mozzarilla.cfg

Otherwise, you can find it here(PYTHON is the location of your python installation):
    PYTHON\Lib\site-packages\mozzarilla\mozzarilla.cfg

If you don't know where python is installed to, you can find it in your systems PATH
variable. If not, then Google how to find it or start searching your HDD lol.
